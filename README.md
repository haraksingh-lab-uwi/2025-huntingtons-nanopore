## Abstract
**Background:** Huntington’s Disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG expansion in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. Due to its non-specific and variable phenotype, diagnosis requires clinical assessments and genetic testing. In the Caribbean, the genetic etiology of HD is underexplored due to the unavailability of genetic testing.

**Objectives:** We investigated whether 32 participants from 4 multigenerational families from Trinidad and Tobago (T&T) presenting with Huntington-like symptoms carried HTT CAG expansions, and whether progressive expansion was related to decreasing age of onset with each generation.

**Results:** All symptomatic participants carried HTT CAG expansions (42-57 CAGs), confirming HD. Among participants aged 20-65 years (n=24), clinical and genetic diagnoses were 100% concordant for 22 participants (13 symptomatic with 42-57 CAGs, and 9 asymptomatic with 13-27 CAGs). Two asymptomatic participants aged 22 and 43 years carried 46-47 and 37-39 CAGs, respectively. Among 8 participants &lt;18 years, one symptomatic 16 year old carried 49-50 CAGs, and 7 are currently asymptomatic (3 with 50-52 CAGs, and 4 with 14-17 CAGs). In all families, progressive expansion and decreasing age of onset was observed in each successive generation. Methods were highly correlated (r2 = 0.998).

**Conclusions:** We demonstrated the novel application of nanopore sequencing with a custom bioinformatics workflow to accurately size HTT CAG repeats. This is the first genetic report of HD in T&T, among limited records in the Caribbean.
